The Gale-Shapley algorithm, also known as the stable marriage algorithm, is used to solve the stable marriage problem. 
In this problem, there are two groups of individuals, for example, men and women, each having their own preferences over the members of the opposite group. 
The goal is to find a stable matching, where no individuals in the two groups prefer each other over their current partners.

In the algorithm, the input is structured as follows:

    Integer N: Represents the cardinality of each group.

    For 2*N lines: For each person from 0 to 2*N-1, input their list of preferences of size N.
