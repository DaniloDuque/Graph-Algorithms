# Graph Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my repository of graph algorithms implemented in C++ and Java. Whether you're an ICPC team member or a programming enthusiast, this collection is tailored to provide efficient and well-documented implementations of essential graph algorithms.

## Introduction to Graphs

Graphs, in the realm of discrete mathematics, are a fundamental data structure that consists of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting these nodes. The edges can be directed or undirected, and they represent relationships or connections between entities. Mathematically, a graph G is defined as a pair (V, E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges, each connecting a pair of vertices.

### Types of Graphs

- **Directed Graph (Digraph):** Edges have a direction.
- **Undirected Graph:** Edges are bidirectional.
- **Weighted Graph:** Edges have associated weights.
- **Bipartite Graph:** Vertices can be divided into two sets with edges only between sets.
- **Flow Graph:** A specialized directed graph where edges have capacities, representing the maximum amount of flow that can traverse the edge.

### Why Graphs in Computer Science?
Graphs model real-world relationships and dependencies, making them indispensable in various computer science applications. They are used in social network analysis, route planning, dependency resolution, and more.

### DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Explores a graph by going as deep as possible before backtracking.
- Commonly used for topological sorting and finding connected components.

- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

### Topological Sort
- Orders the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) linearly based on dependencies.
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

### Kahn's Algorithm
