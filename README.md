# Graph Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Graph Algorithms Repository! This repository contains implementations and explanations of various graph algorithms commonly used in computer science and related fields. Whether you're a student learning about graph theory or a developer seeking efficient solutions for graph-related problems, this repository provides comprehensive resources for understanding and applying these algorithms.

## Algorithms Included

### Classic Graph Traversal Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explore a graph level by level, finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explore a graph as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Shortest Path Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes, handling negative-weight edges and detecting negative cycles.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.

### Strongly Connected Components and Topological Sorting
- **Tarjan's Algorithm:** Find strongly connected components in a directed graph and detect articulation points and bridges.
- **Topological Sort:** Order the vertices of a directed acyclic graph in such a way that for every directed edge u â†’ v, vertex u comes before v.

### Maximum Flow and Bipartite Graphs
- **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm:** Find the maximum flow in a flow network.
- **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm:** A specific implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method that uses BFS for path search.
- **Bipartite Graph Coloring:** Determine if a graph is bipartite (can be colored using two colors without any adjacent vertices having the same color).

### Minimum Spanning Trees
- **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Find a minimum spanning tree for a connected, undirected graph.
- **Prim's Algorithm:** Find a minimum spanning tree for a connected, undirected graph, adding vertices and edges incrementally.

### Game Theory
- **Gale-Shapley Algorithm:** Solve the stable marriage problem and find stable matchings between two sets of elements.

### Disjoint-Set Data Structure
- **Union-Find Algorithm:** Efficiently manage a partition of elements into disjoint subsets and perform union and find operations.
