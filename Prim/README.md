# Prim's Algorithm

## Overview

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. Similar to Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm finds the subset of edges that forms a tree with all the vertices and the minimum total edge weight. Prim's algorithm builds the MST by adding vertices and edges incrementally, always choosing the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.

## How Prim's Algorithm Works

1. **Initialization:** Start with an arbitrary vertex as the initial MST. Initialize a set to keep track of vertices in the MST and a priority queue (min-heap) to store candidate edges.

2. **Select Minimum Edge:** At each step, select the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.

3. **Add Vertex and Edge:** Add the selected vertex and edge to the MST. Update the priority queue with the edges connected to the newly added vertex.

4. **Termination:** Continue this process until all vertices are included in the MST.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of Prim's algorithm is **O(E log V)**, where **V** is the number of vertices and **E** is the number of edges in the graph. Here's why:

- **Priority Queue Operations:** Extracting the minimum edge from the priority queue takes **O(log V)** time, and there are at most **E** edges in the priority queue.

- **Updating Priority Queue:** Inserting and updating edges in the priority queue is done **E** times.

Combining both aspects, the overall time complexity is **O(E log V)**.

## When to Use Prim's Algorithm

Prim's algorithm is suitable when:

- **Dense Graphs:** The graph is dense, meaning it has a relatively large number of edges compared to the number of vertices.

- **Edge Weights:** The graph edges have arbitrary or non-negative weights.

- **Finding Minimum Spanning Tree:** You want to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

Prim's algorithm performs well in dense graphs where the number of edges is close to the maximum possible edges (i.e., E is close to V^2). It is commonly used in network design, especially for finding the minimum cost of connecting all the nodes in a dense network.
