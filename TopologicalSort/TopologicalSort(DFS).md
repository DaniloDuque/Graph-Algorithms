# Topological Sort Algorithm

## Overview

Topological sorting is a linear ordering of the vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in such a way that for every directed edge \(u \rightarrow v\), vertex \(u\) comes before \(v\) in the ordering. Topological sorting has various applications, especially in scheduling, task sequencing, and dependency resolution problems, where tasks must be executed in a specific order without violating any dependencies.

## How Topological Sort Works

1. **DFS-Based Approach:** Perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph.

2. **Topological Ordering:** During the DFS traversal, vertices are visited recursively. When a vertex and all its adjacent vertices are visited, add the vertex to the beginning of the topological ordering.

3. **Termination:** Continue this process until all vertices are included in the topological ordering.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of topological sorting using DFS is **O(V + E)**, where **V** is the number of vertices and **E** is the number of edges in the graph. Here's why:

- **DFS Traversal:** Performing a depth-first search takes **O(V + E)** time to visit all vertices and edges.

- **Constructing Topological Order:** Building the topological ordering by inserting vertices at the beginning of the ordering list takes **O(V)** time.

Combining both aspects, the overall time complexity is **O(V + E)**.

## When to Use Topological Sort Algorithm

Topological sorting is suitable when:

- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):** You are dealing with a directed graph without cycles. Topological sorting is applicable only to DAGs.

- **Dependency Resolution:** You need to resolve dependencies between tasks or events. Tasks can be executed in the order provided by the topological sort.

- **Scheduling Problems:** You want to schedule tasks or events in a way that satisfies all dependencies and constraints.

- **Efficiency:** You need an efficient algorithm with linear time complexity for both vertices and edges.
